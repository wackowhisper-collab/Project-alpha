# The Gem Daddy Initiative

## Queen Bee Investing, Baby NFT

### High-Level Vision & Mission
- **Vision**: To create a decentralized, community-governed investment fund focused on identifying and investing in high-potential, early-stage crypto assets ("Gems").
- **Mission**: The "Queen Bee" NFT holders ("The Queen Bees") will collectively govern a multi-sig Treasury ("Gem Daddy's Chest") and receive proportional returns from the collective investments. The "Baby NFT" is the access and governance token.

### Tokenomics & Utility
- **Queen Bee NFT**:
  - A fixed collection (e.g., 5,000 NFTs).
  - Governance: Vote on proposals.
  - Access: Exclusive community channels.
  - Revenue Share: Share profits quarterly.
- **Treasury Strategy**:
  - 90% of mint proceeds → Investment Treasury.
